### `npm start` or `expo start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:19002](http://localhost:19002) to view it in the browser.

### Choose one of the following options to view the app:

#### Viewing on mobile device (iOS)

1. Download Expo Go from the App Store
2. Scan the QR Code (using Camera app) located at the bottom left after navigating to [http://localhost:19002](http://localhost:19002). This should bring you to the Expo Go app where you can view the app directly.

#### Running on a Simulator
Expo CLI allows you to run the React Native app on a physical device without setting up a development environment. Once your simulator/emulator is set up, you may run the the following scripts. Please note that not all features are fully functional through a Simulator.
